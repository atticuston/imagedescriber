Ai image describer that i made as a template for future projects works using tkinter &amp; llava (an ollama module) 
You can download ollama here: https://ollama.com/  
and here are the libraries you have to install if u wanna run this yourself: ```pip install requests``` and ```pip install pillow```
if you don't wanna go through all the trouble i've complied the file as an exe using pyinstaller please notice that it may be flagged as false positives if you don't trust it feel free to compile it yourself.
